# popWinTracker

This simple scraper goes to [basketball-reference.com's](https://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/popovgr99c.html) stats page for Gregg Popovich to see how many wins he has.

It then checks to see how many he needs to become the all-time leader in regular season wins and formats it into a string for a widget on the [San Antonio Express-News' home page](expressnews.com/).

More than anything, I'm just practicing with [git scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).
